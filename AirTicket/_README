3 layer MVC project is created.
Change "ProjectPath" in web.config file to your project folder.
XML files are located in Data\Computers at root path.
Output Html files will be generated in folder Data\Output.
Xslt file is located at \Resources".

Run the project and see screenshots on how to test the application.

1. XML read and html write operations are assumed to be data related therefore code is put in repository in data access layer(DL)
2. Transformation to html are business related operations therefore code is in business layer of project(BL)
3. Windsor Castle IOC is implemented for DI.

Mocking and testing
1. Goal of testing is to test business logic not data.
2. Mocking framework MOQ is used to mock repository dependency in services and test business logic.
3. Need to pass real XML and Xslt data to test html tranformation logic because actual transformation code sits in services.
(unlike read/write where we can send any test data because we are not interested in data test but logic test)
See test method Transform_Xml_and_Xslt_to_Html.

Publisher Consumer pattern with threading is not implemented because I am not very confident in that pattern. 
It is something I can learn and do if you think it to be of utmost important.
Please let me know.
